# OSI Model Overview

This repository provides an in-depth look at the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model, detailing each layer, its functions, and how it facilitates communication across networks.

## OSI Model Layers

The OSI model is divided into seven distinct layers, each with specific roles:

1. **Physical Layer**: Transmits raw bitstreams over a physical medium, dealing with hardware elements.
2. **Data Link Layer**: Ensures error-free transfer of data frames between nodes. It manages MAC addresses and physical addressing.
3. **Network Layer**: Manages data packet routing through logical addressing (IP addresses), enabling different networks to connect.
4. **Transport Layer**: Responsible for end-to-end communication and error recovery. Uses protocols like TCP and UDP.
5. **Session Layer**: Manages sessions and connections between applications, ensuring synchronization.
6. **Presentation Layer**: Transforms data formats between the application and network, handling encryption, compression, and translation.
7. **Application Layer**: Closest to the user, providing network services like email, file transfer, and web browsing.
